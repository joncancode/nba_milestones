Lebron James' stats (2544)
http://data.nba.net/10s/prod/v1/2018/players/2544_profile.json
- point tracker - as create a ladder to top 5


Westbook's stats (201566)
it would be cool to have a triple double tracker, but instead of total stats like using Lebron's page above, it may be better to use actual game data for him.

maybe use the gamelog for him? this has last 3 games of stats!
